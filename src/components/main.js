    Offering Registered Family Child Care to Las Vegas, Henderson and surrounding areas!

Hours of Operation 
Monday - Friday
(Every other Friday)
7:00am - 9:30pm
(emergency night or weekend care also available)
we believe children learn best while having fun!
We consider it an honor and privilege to minister to your family by proving a loving, secure, and 
fun daycare environment - a place where your child can explore, learn principles for living, 
by having good role models who show compassion and love, and by having fun! 
 <br/>
 <h4>Health and Safety</h4>
You put your trust in us to care for your child when you can’t. 
And even though our day is full of giggling and 
wiggling, we take that responsibility very seriously! 
That’s why you’ll see that everything we do—from enforcing building security, 
to hiring trustworthy caregivers, to protecting your community 
from COVID-19—protects your child in every way. 
<br/>
When your child is here, we take every measure to protect them while giving them ample 
freedom to discover new things. Every classroom is kid-proof, 
so the things in arms-reach are safe for your child to explore.
 Our doors are locked during business hours and 
 only opened for authorized staff and enrolled families.
  Only pre-approved people with photo identification may pick-up your child.

 <h3> Feel confident in our staff.</h3>
Your child’s teachers and center staff might grow to feel like extended family! That’s because they are:
<br/>
 <h4>Talented </h4>

Our staff are trained in child development, early-childhood education, or a related field, 
and they’re certified in pediatric first aid and CPR. 
And, you can trust that we hire top talent.
 We’re the only early childhood education provider to partner with Gallup® to find caregivers who are the best fit for our culture, purpose, and values.  

<h4>Trustworthy</h4>

Everyone on our staff has passed a criminal background check as one 
important step in making sure we hire the best caregivers for your child. 

<br/>
<h3>Come on into our squeaky-clean classrooms!</h3>
Cleaning your child’s classroom happens all day, in every way! 
Our hospital-grade cleaning products are powerful on big germs but gentle your little gems. 
We use them throughout the day to sanitize high-touch surfaces, toys, and 
playground equipment (and we store them out of children’s reach).

<h3>KinderCare's Food & Child Nutrition Program</h3>


Well-nourished kids make the best learners! That’s why nutritious meals and snacks are provided every day—and 
they’re all included in your tuition. Even if your child has allergies or dietary restrictions, 
we’ll serve up safe and delicious menu options created by nutrition education experts. 
At mealtimes, your child will get brave trying new things, practice good table manners, 
learn to share, and discover the flavors and textures of world foods!
